Description:

To pass the series of gates guarded by the owls, Kenneth needs to present them each with a highly realistic portrait of one. Unfortunately, he is absolutely rubbish at drawing, and needs some code to return a brand new portrait with a moment's notice.

All owl heads look like this:

''0v0''
Such beautiful eyes! However, they differ in their plumage, which is always symmetrical, eg.:

   VVHVAV''0v0''VAVHVV
or

YYAYAH8XH''0v0''HX8HAYAYY
So Kenneth needs a method that will take a garble of text generated by mashing at his keyboard (numbers and letters, but he knows how to avoid punctuation etc.) for a bit and give him a symmetrical owl with a lovely little face, with a truly symmetrical plumage made of uppercase letters and numbers.

(To be clear, the acceptable characters for the plumage are 8,W,T,Y,U,I,O,A,H,X,V and M.)
