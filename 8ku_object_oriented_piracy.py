Description:

Ahoy matey!

You are a leader of a small pirate crew. And you have a plan. With the help of OOP you wish to make a pretty eficient system to identify ships with a heavy booty on board.

Unfortunattely for you, people weigh a lot this days, so how do you know if a ship if full of gold and not people?

You begin with writing a generic Ship class:

class Ship:
    def __init__(self, draft, crew):
        self.draft = draft
        self.crew = crew
Every time your spies see a new ship enter the dock, they will create a new ship object:

Titanic = Ship(15,10)
Now comes the tricky part: An average man will sink the ship by exactly 1.5 units. (Ship's draft goes up) That means the draft can show the estimated weight of the presumable booty aboard.

if it weighs more than 20 without people, it is worthy to board. Your system should have a method

is_worth_it
to decide that:

Titanic.is_worth_it() #return false
This Kata teaches you the very basic of method creation.

Good luck!

        return self.draft - self.crew * 1.5 > 20
