Description:

You've started a heating company with an oddly-mathematical All-Time Max, Min, Mean and Mode Temperature Guaranteeâ„¢.

Write a class TempTracker with these methods:

insert()    # records a new temperature
get_max()   # returns the highest temp we've seen so far
get_min()   # returns the lowest temp we've seen so far
get_mean()  # returns the mean of all temps we've seen so far
get_mode()  # returns the temp we've seen the most times so far
Do not store every single temperature inserted. You expect to get so much input that you won't be able to store all the temperatures in memory. Optimize for space and time. The time and space costs of your functions should all be O(1)!

The function to get the mean should return a float, but the rest of the get functions can return integers. If no temperatures have been inserted yet, the get functions should return null objects. Temperatures will all be inserted as integers. You'll record your temperatures in Fahrenheit, so you can assume they'll all be in the range 0 to 110.

If there is more than one mode, return any of the modes.
